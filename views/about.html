	<h2>About me</h2>	
	<p>I get inspired when food is the purest form of itself. A peach from a farmer’s market at the end of August tastes exactly like a peach should. I’ve worked at a grocery store and two farms, and can attest to the fact that eating seasonally will change your take on everyday cooking. My intention is to make food taste good through using natural ingredients: whole grains, healthy fats, natural sugar alternatives and the like. I would qualify salad as my favorite food, but a bit of indulgence will certainly wiggle in amongst the vegetables. I don't subscribe to one particular diet or foods that are labeled as "good" or "bad." I try to eat a lot of produce... that's the short story. What I can promise is that here, you will find recipes that use seasonal ingredients, with an intention to not overcomplicate natural foods. I don’t really measure, so the recipes are usually educated guesses that should work for you. Alter my suggestions based on your own tastes- a little more of this, a little less of that.</p>
